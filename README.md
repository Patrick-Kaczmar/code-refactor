# Code-Refactor

Refactored the code inside the HTML and CSS files. For the HTML file, all non-semantic tags have been changed to semantic ones for ease of accessibility and reading.

The CSS file was refactored to match the new semantic tags of the HTML file. The CSS code was also reorganized so all the selector tags fall in order with their respective sub elements.
